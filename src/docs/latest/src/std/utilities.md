# Utilities

These are some of the smaller utilities and functionality that are usually globally available regardless of the `Astra` namespace:

## Pretty Print

`pprint` function is a wrapper over `print` function that also lets you print tables as well as other values.

## String Split

`string.split` splits a string according to the seperator provided and result into an array of chunks.

## Dotenv

It is always a good idea to never include sensitive API keys within your server code. For these reasons we usually recommend using a `.env` file. Astra automatically loads them if they are present in the same folder into the environment, accessible through the `os.getenv`. You can also load your own file using the global `Astra.dotenv_load` function.

This is the load order of these files (They can overwrite the ones loaded previously):

- `.env`
- `.env.production`
- `.env.prod`
- `.env.development`
- `.env.dev`
- `.env.test`
- `.env.local`

## Regex

Astra has support for a very performant regex engine. The regex code is advised to be compiled once and reused multiple times to save up even more on performence. Example:

```lua
-- Create a new regex
local my_re = Astra.regex([[(?:index)?\.(html|lua|tera)$]])

-- Capture all of the hits as list of string lists (string[][])
pprint(my_re:captures([[
path/to/file.html
examples/templates/index.html
src/components/base.tera
]]))

-- Check for matches available
pprint(my_re:is_match("static/index.lua"))

-- Or replace matches
local content = "examples/templates/index.html"
local to_replace_with = ""
local number_of_replaces = 1 -- can omit it and not add it at all as argument
local new_string = my_re:replace(content, to_replace_with, number_of_replaces)
pprint(new_string)
```
